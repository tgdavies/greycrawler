I am currently in foster care with an amazing foster mum - have a read of what she says about me! He's really into his daily walks these days. Once he’s fully settled into a home and has started going on consistent walks around the same location, he gets really into his sniffaris and checking the pee-mail… we walk partly on the road in the quiet streets, then along the footpath on a busier road around the park (helps stop his nails getting too long) and he loves checking out each tree and is quite interested in clover patches. He’s been quite brave. He’s progressed from half hour walks and now he seems to like to meander around for an hour up and down the hills in the park, we only actually walk about 2 kms, so not a long walk. Some days he starts out strong and pulls you along at a good pace until he gets a little tired or distracted with smells, other days it’s a slow meander with lots of stops to smell everything. He would definitely benefit from a playmate at times, or maybe some playdates. Jak is quite lazy with his eating habits, preferring to take his meals in bed or on the couch where he can lie down while he eats – he’s also very partial to dental chews. What’s best suited to Jak Jak: ✅ Quiet and calm household with no kids ✅ Another calm, gentle and confident large sized dog that could show him the ropes ✅ A yard (so he can toilet and have an escape if needed) ✅ Full time workers with a courtyard/backyard access **Jak Jak is on daily medication which he takes straight off the peanut-butter covered spoon his foster mum gives him! **","jak-jak-1",""

Sooty has spent time in a foster home where he has gotten the hang of all things 'pet life'. He had no troubles with toilet training and was always a quiet boy, often sneaking up onto the couch for a snooze. He loved going for walks with his carers, and was known to pinch the odd loaf of garlic bread from the kitchen. He's looking for home without children as he much prefers the quiet company of his adult hoomans. Sooty would like a home with a backyard and plenty of space to play. He'll be happy to stay at home while you're at work, and would suit full-time workers. Sooty could potentially go to a home with a small canine companion pending a meet and great. If you think Sooty would suit your lifestyle and your looking to welcome greyhound into your home enquire today.","sooty-1",""
