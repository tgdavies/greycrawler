Once he’s fully settled into a home and has started going on consistent walks around the same location, he gets really into his sniffaris and checking the pee-mail… we walk partly on the road in the quiet streets, then along the footpath on a busier road around the park (helps stop his nails getting too long) and he loves checking out each tree and is quite interested in clover patches. He’s been quite brave. He’s progressed from half hour walks and now he seems to like to meander around for an hour up and down the hills in the park, we only actually walk about 2 kms, so not a long walk. Some days he starts out strong and pulls you along at a good pace until he gets a little tired or distracted with smells, other days it’s a slow meander with lots of stops to smell everything. He would definitely benefit from a playmate at times, or maybe some playdates. Jak is quite lazy with his eating habits, preferring to take his meals in bed or on the couch where he can lie down while he eats – he’s also very partial to dental chews.
